	This project's target is solving problems of POJ,http://poj.org/,PKU JudgeOnline.
	Basically, each class in folder 'src' under package 'com.andy.oj' is dealling with one problem. 
	Some classes have their related unit test class in folder 'test' under package 'com.andy.oj'. As the best practise of unit test suggested.
	Discussing is welcomed. ^.^.
	I'm trying to be very professional at coding.
